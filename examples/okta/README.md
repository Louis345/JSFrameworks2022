# Okta Example

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Getting Started

This is an example for the _exercises/15-okta_ exercise. You need a _.env_ file with the Okta configuration saved either in the same location as this _README.md_ or inside of _exercises/15-okta_. If you do not have a _.env_ file, follow the instructions inside of [the Okta exercise's README.md](../../exercises/15-okta/README.md) on how to create one.

Before starting this application, you will also need to install the companion authorization and API server. Please follow the _Getting Started_ steps [in this README.md](../../authorization-server/README.md).

Once that is installed, you can get started by running:

```bash
cd examples/okta/
npm install
npm start
```

If, at any time, you need to stop the app, press `ctrl+c`.
