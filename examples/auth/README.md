# Simple Authentication & Authorization Example

## Getting Started

Before starting this application, you will need to install the companion authorization and API server. Please follow the _Getting Started_ steps [in this README.md](../../authorization-server/README.md).

Once that is installed, you can get started by running:

```bash
cd examples/auth/
npm install
npm start
```

If, at any time, you need to stop the app, press `ctrl+c`.
