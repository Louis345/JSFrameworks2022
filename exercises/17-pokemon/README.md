# Zustand Pokemon Challenge

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Examples and Documentation

Zustand resources:

See [https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/recipes/](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/recipes/)

### Reasons for the Challenge

Zustand is a state management library and refactoring this code will help you understand the benefits of using it.

#### User Stories

As a user, I would like to select a favorite pokemon from a list of pokemon. I should be able to see all my favorite pokemon in a list.

##### Acceptance Criteria

The App should keep all of the existing functionality and the state should be managed by Zustand.

The App should also be converted to Typescript.
